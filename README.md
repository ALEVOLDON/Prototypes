# Prototypes

**Prototypes** is an experimental web application for organizing and discovering online IT meetups. The project was initiated to provide a space for developers and tech enthusiasts to connect, collaborate, and share knowledge—especially during times when in-person events are not feasible.

## 📌 Overview

The project's goal is to build a simple yet effective platform where users can:

- Discover and filter upcoming online events.
- Create and share their own meetups.
- Interact with others in real time.

Currently, this is a prototype focusing on layout, interface, and core user interactions.

- `css/`, `scss/` — Stylesheets and SCSS files.
- `js/` — JavaScript files for UI logic.
